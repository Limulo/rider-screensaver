Lone Knight is the first videogame experiment made by XX YY inspired by M F and T & A S works in order to take part to the itch.io FTJ.
Tech notes
Lone Knight is a web app that takes adv.. of the html 5 canvas object strength. Like the old '80 and '90 s videogames, the indexed colors and palette shifting techniques are implemented.

The artwork has been made by G on the basis of an old flash animation project. The images have been converted in pixel art paintings using Aseprite. 
The code has been written by N.

The very first videogame version resolution is 320x240 pixels, with a pseudocolor palette with 256 colors.

Game assets:
- 1 spriteshhet with 12 knight animation sprites. This describes the main game element animation.
- 4 files describing the 4 parallax elements.

The images are converted in JSON, so they can be parsed by the JS code.
This conversion has been also useful to include in the same element file different information regarding the local pseudocolor palettes (8 for each element).

Here's a snippet of a JSOn file used in the game:
XXX

PALETTE SHIFTING
As time goes by, every color in the main pse… palette is given as the interpolation between the different local palettes corresponding colors.
Every local pse… palette entry represent  one of the element colors at a given hour of the day. 
Entry 0 is always the key color.

here's an example:
XXX

Thus, thanks to this technique, every pixels is colored with the appropriate nuance according to the time flow.

Future improvements
As an homage to the old videogames, the next improvement will be the introduction of the color cycling feature.
